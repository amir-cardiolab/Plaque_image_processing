## About Plaque_quantification_MATLAB
This software package uses MATLAB App Designer to perform vulnerable plaque quantification. The software consists of three main sections: Visualization of DICOM image series and centerline creation, semi-automatic segmentation of arterial cross-section, and plaque quantification.

The software uses Frangi's vesselness filter, active contour levelset method, and membership functions for the segmention process. Also, the Adaptive Threshold method is used for quantification of various plaque characteristics.

It is developed in Cardiovascular Biomechanics Lab, NAU, by Mostafa Mahmoudi under direction of Dr. Amirhossein Arzani.


## Installation
